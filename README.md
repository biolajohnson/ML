This is my attempt on implementing classic ML algorithms. This will be written in python
Algorithms to implement:
- decision trees
- support vector machines
- logistic regression
- linear regression
- linear discriminant models
- guassion models
- perceptrons
- neural networks
  - CNN
  - RNN
  - GANs
  - LSTM
  - Transformers
